# Statistics

Statistics is a Foundation framework for calculating&mdash;no points
for guessing it&mdash;statistics. It is inspired by Perl's <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Statistics-Descriptive/">
Statistics::Descriptive</a> and like it consists of two main classes.

SBStatistics calculates a range of statistical measurements on the fly
as each data point is added. The data is then immediately discarded,
giving it a very low memory footprint.

SBFullStatistics in turn subclasses SBStatistics and records each data
point. It is therefore able to provide more advanced statistical
functions. The trade-off is that it can consume a lot of memory if you
are collecting a lot of data.

## Examples

The following example assumes you have included the @p
Statistics/Statistics.h header and somehow linked to the Statistics
framework:

    // Create statistics object
    SBStatistics *stat = [SBStatistics new];

    // Add some random data points
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        [stat addData:[NSNumber numberWithInt:random()/1000.0]];

    // Format report
    id fmt = [NSMutableArray array];
    [fmt addObject:@"Data set consists of %u data points."];
    [fmt addObject:@" * Min:      %f"];
    [fmt addObject:@" * Max:      %f"];
    [fmt addObject:@" * Mean:     %f"];
    [fmt addObject:@" * Variance: %f"];
    [fmt addObject:@" * StdDev:   %f"];

    // Print it
    NSLog([fmt componentsJoinedByString:@"\n"],
        stat.count,
        stat.min,
        stat.max,
        stat.mean,
        [stat variance],
        [stat standardDeviation]
    );

The SBFullStatistics class can do other interesting stuff:

    // Create statistics object
    SBFullStatistics *stat = [SBFullStatistics new];

    // Add some random data.
    for (int i = 0; i < 1e4; i++)
        [stat addData:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:random()]];

    // Produce 10 equally-sized buckets covering the entire range
    id buckets = [stat bucketsWithCount:10];

    // Calculate frequency distributions.
    id freq = [stat frequencyDistributionWithBuckets:buckets
                                          cumulative:NO];
    id cfreq = [stat frequencyDistributionWithBuckets:buckets
                                           cumulative:YES];

    // Iterate over the buckets and output the values
    for (id bucket in buckets)
        NSLog(@"%@ => %@ => %@",
            bucket,
            [freq objectForKey:bucket],
            [cfreq objectForKey:bucket]);
