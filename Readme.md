# Statistics

**I've abandoned this project, and will not be supporting it.** Though
it might still work for you!

Like its inspiration (Perl's <a
href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Statistics-Descriptive/">
Statistics::Descriptive</a>), it consists of two main classes.

**SBStatistics** calculates a range of statistical measurements on the
fly as you add data points. The data points are immediately discarded,
giving it a low memory footprint.

**SBFullStatistics** in turn subclasses SBStatistics and keeps each
data point. It is therefore able to provide more advanced statistical
functions. The trade-off is that it can consume a lot of memory if you
are collecting a lot of data.

## Examples

``` objective-c
// Create statistics object
SBStatistics *stat = [SBStatistics new];

// Add some random data points
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
    [stat addData:[NSNumber numberWithInt:random()/1000.0]];

// Format report
id fmt = [NSMutableArray array];
[fmt addObject:@"Data set consists of %u data points."];
[fmt addObject:@" * Min:      %f"];
[fmt addObject:@" * Max:      %f"];
[fmt addObject:@" * Mean:     %f"];
[fmt addObject:@" * Variance: %f"];
[fmt addObject:@" * StdDev:   %f"];

// Print it
NSLog([fmt componentsJoinedByString:@"\n"],
    stat.count,
    stat.min,
    stat.max,
    stat.mean,
    [stat variance],
    [stat standardDeviation]
);
```

The SBFullStatistics class can do more interesting stuff:

``` objective-c
// Create statistics object
SBFullStatistics *stat = [SBFullStatistics new];

// Add some random data.
for (int i = 0; i < 1e4; i++)
    [stat addData:[NSNumber numberWithDouble:random()]];

// Produce 10 equally-sized buckets covering the entire range
id buckets = [stat bucketsWithCount:10];

// Calculate frequency distributions.
id freq = [stat frequencyDistributionWithBuckets:buckets
                                      cumulative:NO];
id cfreq = [stat frequencyDistributionWithBuckets:buckets
                                       cumulative:YES];

// Iterate over the buckets and output the values
for (id bucket in buckets)
	NSLog(@"%@ => %@ => %@",
		bucket,
		[freq objectForKey:bucket],
		[cfreq objectForKey:bucket]);
```
